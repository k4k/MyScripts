# MyScripts
This repository contains scripts that I've written over the years.

Most of these scripts will be in bash and compatible with Fedora/Redhat systems.
There are a few scripts in here that were written on Slackware or FreeBSD that
may need some minor tweaking on other platforms. I've tried to indicate in the
comments when this might be the case, but I'm only human.

This repo is roughly organized such that the top level contains all the bash
scripts. Scripts written in other languages are split up in to their respective
folders.

# Warranty
There is no warranty. I wrote these for me. While I do my best to provide some
basic sanity checking, some of these scripts do some pretty destructive things.
If you don't know what a script does, don't use it. If you think I've done
something wrong, feel free to correct my mistake and submit a pull request.
